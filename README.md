## ROUTING
*
Routing is the project that we, *Group-29* have worked upon for our DSA mini-project.

*
### IDEALOGY
*
We try to make a program that helps users to find the safest and shortest time consuming path from one place(a node) in the city to other place(another node) in the city(graph).
We made a graph(as a representation of city) with roads as edges and their weights as
length(length of road), cars(number of cars) and devised a simple formula to calculate time taken to move through a road in relation with the number of cars on the road.
We use Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path and the safest path.
Safest path was found using time taken data for the previous 5 days of the week.
